In the Summer of 2017, my 18-year-old self was amidst a whirlpool of stress. I was coming to the end of my Leaving Certificate exams as I was preparing to sit my final paper in Physics. I had a weekend beforehand to lock my door and bury my head in past exam papers, but instead, I went for a coffee.

This coffee would prove to be one of the most life changing drinks I will probably ever have. I was fortunate enough to have been offered a job as a Mobile app developer at CarTrawler, an Irish travel tech giant. Prior to that coffee, I had planned to study computer science and law at Maynooth University. That did not transpire.

When I broke the news to my family, I was met with mixed emotions. Some were excited for me, others told me that at my age, I should be &quot;thinking _inside_ the box&quot;. Either way, the reactions I got (all well-meaning and appreciated) cemented in my mind that the decision I was making, was the right one.

I began my career as a developer having a very basic handle on HTML and CSS, little to no knowledge of JavaScript, and zero understanding of mobile app development. The first three months were akin to a marathon in which the finish line is clouded in fog. I worked hard to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and React Native, all the while trying to transition from a schoolboy mindset, to a professional one.

After a year and a half at CarTrawler, I had learned more than I could imagine. I gained experience in the entire product lifecycle. From concept and design, the development process, all the way to testing and CI/CD integrations.

In January of 2019 however, I was made redundant from CarTrawler as part of a companywide restructure. I immediately started looking for new jobs as the stress of not having a college degree and only a year and a half of experience became all too apparent.

Per contra, it was for the best, as I was fortunate enough to meet Diarmuid Byrne, co-founder alongside Sam Watson of EquiRatings; a startup looking to bring data analysis and insight into the equestrian world.

Diarm&#39;s approach to the hiring process was a refreshing one. After a month of Leet Code and HackerRank interview assignments, I was asked instead to conduct a code review on one of EquiRatings React apps and give some design feedback on the site itself. This holistic approach to the interview process was a brilliantly efficient one that made the thought of working for EquiRatings exciting.

I began my work as Front-End Lead at EquiRatings in March of 2019, working alongside a team of 5 wonderful and talented people, a big change from the 500 or so equally wonderful people at CarTrawler. Over the next two years I would work closely with them to develop a range of products, from high performance dashboards used by Olympic managers, risk dashboards used by events and governing bodies to mitigate horse and rider falls, all the way to what I consider the peak of my career thus far, the Eventing Manager app.

Eventing Manager is a fantasy equestrian game that allows players to create a team of their four favorite rider/horse combinations at a competition. The app garnered over 10,000 users and won an award at the SAP Innovation awards in 2021.

The app was a great success for EquiRatings, and me personally, as it taught me that once you put your mind to something and do your best to maintain focus, anything is possible.

Aside from Eventing Manager, my time at EquiRatings showed me what it&#39;s like to work in a small, dedicated and amicable team of people who all have a hunger to make a change, a type of work environment that I discovered is well suited to me.

The past two and a half years have gone by in the blink of an eye, but they have been chock full of growth, development, and above all else, happiness. I now, however, look forward to the next stage of my life as I begin to work for EquiRatings in a part time capacity and prepare to move to the Netherlands to begin my BSc in Economics and Business Economics at the University of Utrecht, a move that for those who have known me long enough, comes as no surprise.

The thought of starting life somewhat anew in a foreign country is a daunting one. New people, new challenges, new opportunities. But if taking big chances has taught me anything, whether you&#39;re moving onwards, upwards, or even sideways too - everything comes up millhouse in the end.

The list of people I owe thanks to is ever growing, as many people have supported me and been involved in getting me to where I am today. Thank you to Bobby Healy, for taking a chance on my naïve 18-year-old self. Thank you to Diarmuid Byrne, Sam Watson and the whole team at EquiRatings for taking a chance on my naïve 19-year-old self. Thank you to Conor Wade, who acted as an external mentor throughout my time at EquiRatings, and from who I learned so much from. Thank you to my friend Brian, who worked alongside me for much of this journey, and from whom I draw constant inspiration from. Thank you to my family for always being supportive and helpful in my journey, and thank you to my Mum, whose love, guidance and care I would be lost without.

Tot ziens! - Harry
